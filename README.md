# AI-Powered-Stock-Price-Forecasting-Case-Study

## Overview

The goal of this project is to **forecast stock price movements** using a combination of **statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models**. By analyzing **10+ years of historical NSE stock data**, the project explores how different algorithms perform in predicting stock trends and provides actionable **Buy/Sell/Hold recommendations**.

This case study demonstrates how **data-driven forecasting** can empower financial decision-making by combining classical time series approaches with modern AI techniques.

## Dataset Description

The project uses historical stock price data downloaded via **Yahoo Finance** (yfinance). The dataset includes:

* **Date**: Trading date
* **Open**: Opening price of the stock
* **High**: Highest price of the stock on that date
* **Low**: Lowest price of the stock on that date
* **Close**: Closing price of the stock
* **Volume**: Number of shares traded
* **Engineered Features**: Year, month, day, day of week, lags, rolling averages, volatility measures

---

## Notebook Explanation

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**

* Collected **10 years of NSE stock data** using yfinance
* Handled missing values and standardized date formats
* Created additional features: lags, rolling mean, rolling std, calendar features

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Trend visualization of stock prices over time
* Seasonal and volatility patterns
* Volume-price relationship analysis

### 3. **Forecasting Models Implemented**

* **Statistical Model**: ARIMA
* **Machine Learning Models**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost
* **Deep Learning Models**: LSTM, GRU
* **Hybrid/Other Models**: Prophet

### 4. **Model Evaluation**

* Metrics: RMSE, RÂ², Accuracy, Direction (Up/Down)
* Compared performance of all models
* Selected best-performing model for final recommendation

### 5. **Final Recommendation System**

* Generates **Buy, Sell, or Hold** signals
* Decision based on best-performing model predictions

## Usage

* **Trading & Investment Strategy**: Provides model-driven buy/sell signals
* **Model Benchmarking**: Compare performance across ML/DL/statistical methods
* **Research & Learning**: Demonstrates integration of multiple forecasting techniques
